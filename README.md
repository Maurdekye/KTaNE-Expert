# KTaNE-Expert

This program takes the place of the experts in the asymmetric multiplayer game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes! Simply follow the program's instructions, input information as the program requests it, and it will give you solutions to solving each of the modules in a bomb.

I designed this program mostly as a joke, as it's existence somewhat defeats the purpose of the game. I highly suggest you _don't_ use this program when actually playing the game, as it might take the fun out of frantically trying to figure out the solutions to the modules on your own. Use at your own risk!

Requires Julia 1.5.x+ to run; run the file `ktane-expert.jl` to start the program, and type `help` to get a quick guide on how to use it.
